## Tasks

##  0. Install MySQL mandatory

First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

## 1. Let us in! mandatory

In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

## 2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes mandatory

In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

## 3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? mandatory

Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

## 4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL

## 5.  MySQL backup
